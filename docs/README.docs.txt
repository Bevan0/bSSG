When making a PR for documentation changes, REMEMBER:

- DO NOT change the generated pages directly. Change the content/templates and regenerate the site.
- DO NOT change the content/templates without regenerating the site.
- YOU MUST move the generated pages to the root docs folder and then delete the generated-site folder.

Failure to do any of these will result in a PR rejection.
