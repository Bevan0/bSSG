## Dependencies
You will need Python 3, Python-Markdown, and Watchdog to run this. On Windows, `setup.py` will automatically install these dependencies for you. On Linux, it is recommended to install the dependencies through your package manager, usually in a package called `python-markdown` and `python-watchdog` or similar.

## Installation
Download or `git clone` this repository. Install bSSG by using `python setup.py install`. For Linux users, it is recommended to install the program dependencies through your package manager rather than through pip, see above. Once they are installed, run `python setup.py install`.
