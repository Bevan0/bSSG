bSSG is a simple static site generator written in Python. It accepts both Markdown and HTML content and HTML templates and combines them together into a full static site, alongside a few helpful utilities to make it easier. The project is licensed under the MIT License and is open-source, so feel free to contribute in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bssg-project/bssg)!

You can read the [installation guide](https://bssg-project.github.io/bSSG/install) to get it installed and then read the [quickstart guide](https://bssg-project.github.io/bSSG/quickstart) to learn the basics of bSSG. A full reference manual will be available soon.
